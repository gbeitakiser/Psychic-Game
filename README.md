# Psychic-Game

This game is simple and straightforward, but may just blow your mind! On the user side, it works like this....

Open index.html inside of the Psychic-Game folder using a browser. Then follow the directions and try to guess what letter the computer is thinking of by typing your first guess (must be a letter). If you guess wrong, the letter is pushed to the "You've Guessed" section and value of the "Guesses Left" goes down by one. If you exhaust all guesses, an alert comes up telling you that you lost and then cues a function that resets all variables and allows you to start the game again. 

If you guess right before all guesses are exhausted, an alert comes up telling you that you won and then cues a function that resets all variables and allows you to start the game again. 

If you lose the game four times in a row with zero wins, an alert pops up telling you that you suck at guessing and should probably open the console to see the correct letter console logged.
